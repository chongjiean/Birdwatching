                <h3>Yellow Vented Bulbul</h3>
                <p>A common bird found everywhere in Singapore. The <i>Vent</i> refers to it's <i>butt</i> and can be easily identified by its yellow coloration.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Asian Koel(Female)</h3>
                <p>That 'uwu' bird that annoys everyone with it's call. Females are brown unlike the black male counterpart but both share red eyes. I actually don't have a good shot of the a male koel...</p>

                <h3>Black-naped Oriole</h3>
                <p>A common bird found everywhere in Singapore. Easily identified by its bright yellow color and black markings that extend to its <i>nape</i></p>

                <h3>A juvenile Black-naped Oriole</h3>
                <p>The juvenile actually doesn't have the black nape, throwing me off in identification the first time I saw this bird. Yet, there aren't many yellow birds in Singapore.</p>

                <h3>Pink Neck Green Pigeon (Female)</h3>
                <p>The female counterpart lacks the pink coloration as always in the bird kingdom. The completely green coloration would help it stay more camouflaged in the foliage.</p>

                <h3>Malaysian Pied Fantail</h3>
                <p>Actually a common bird found in many forested places around Singapore. It's known for it's tail that opens like a fan, hence it's name. Till today, I have yet to capture a good image of it's fantail though:(</p>

                <p>A chicken. This chicken though was white and was therefore interesting enough for me to get a shot of. Reminded me of my white chicken rice.</p>

                <h3>Straw Headed Bulbul</h3>
                <p>This species of bulbul is a very unique species of bulbul to Singapore in that Singapore is the only place where it is not endangered or extinct. It has a very distinct call that I am not familiar with as I have only seen this once:(</p>

            <p>Found mainly in Bukit Timah and Bukit Batok parks and reserves. Very distinct white crest but more notable are their calls. I could hear these calls from really far away, making me wonder what sort of commotion was occuring.</p>

                <p>This was taken at Pasir Ris Park. There were an entire group of birdwatchers looking up but my friends and I couldn't see anything.

            <h3>Oriental Honey Buzzard</h3>
            <p>This guy came by when we were distractedly looking at a Black Naped Oriole. We jumped and quickly moved to get shots which gave me a nice motion capture of the buzzard taking off. The buzzard continued flying around the vincity but we could only watch it soar from below.</p>
